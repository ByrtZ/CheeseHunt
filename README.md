# CheeseHunt
Cheese Hunt minigame for Minecraft written in Kotlin.

Cheese Hunt is a minigame idea that was created by MC Championship Testers, and ultimately became a meme within the MC Championship community when a new game for the event was teased. I have decided to bring this to life in the form of a Minecraft server plugin written in Kotlin, with the help of AFluffyGriffin, blueskiesclub and toxicologyover who created the initial concept for the game.
