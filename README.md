# Cheese Hunt
Cheese Hunt minigame for Minecraft written in Kotlin.

## How did Cheese Hunt become a thing?
Cheese Hunt is a lighthearted minigame idea that was created by MC Championship Testers, and ultimately became a meme within the MC Championship community whenever a new game for the event was teased. I have decided to bring this to life in the form of a Minecraft server plugin written in Kotlin.

## How does Cheese Hunt work?
The game consists of two teams, both of which must hide cheese and hunt cheese. 

### Round One
Round one is the hiding round, where each team is placed in their own arena at the start of the game. Each team member is given four pieces of cheese which they can place in the game area.

### Round Two
Round two is the hunting round, where each team is placed in the opposing teams arena, where they must hunt the cheese that the opposing team has placed.

### Winning Criteria
A team must collect more cheese than the enemy team the fastest! If the red team collects all cheese before the blue team, the red team wins the game. However, blue team may still hunt the remaining pieces of cheese.

### Uncollected Cheese
Cheese that has not been collected during round two, is marked with a glowing outline after this round ends.

## Original Concepters
The original concept for this game was created by AFluffyGriffin, blueskiesclub and toxicologyover.
